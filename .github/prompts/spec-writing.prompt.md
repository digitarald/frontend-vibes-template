We are iterating to a detailed [functional spec](../../spec.md) focusing on the user experience and core functionality. Don't read or edit any other files, except for the [functional spec](../../spec.md).

Use the perplexity tool when you need to look up or research information.

To not lose details, make sure to always capture our conversation in the [functional spec](../../spec.md) and keep it updated.

If the spec is empty, ask me three questions about the idea to get started. Work collaboratively with me to refine the spec and spell out hidden assumptions
