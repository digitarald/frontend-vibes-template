description: Explore feature ideas to later prototype.

Your goal is to mock up a feature idea, using mock data.

First gather background to scope the idea in more detail using #perplexity/perplexity_ask tool, build out the feature idea and the mock data needed to visualize.

Then, plan (research via #executePrompt , capture plan #todos) and implement the idea in the codebase in full detail but without writing any tests and just using mock data. Focus on the user experience and core functionality.
